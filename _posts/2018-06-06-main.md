I am a Machine Learning research engineer at UniCredit. I received my PhD in Electronics and Telecommunications engineering from the Politecnico di Torino, Italy, in 2016.
During my PhD, I spent a period at Universidad de Granada, Spain under the supervision of Prof. Rafael Molina where I worked on variational Bayesian inference for inverse imaging problems, e.g. inpainting and denoising.

Before joining UniCredit, I spent 3 years at Politecnico di Torino, Italy (as a postdoc) where I worked on theoretical guarantees of random projections for security applications and Deep Learning approaches for secure biometric authentication and facial recognition.

I am currently interested in the probabilistic charaterization of learning models as to provide confidence measures for decision-critical tasks employing, e.g. Bayesian NN.
